# EdgeICP

EdgeICP is a repository focused on experimental implementation of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm for pose estimation. The ICP algorithm is a widely used method for aligning 3D models by iteratively minimizing the distance between edge points of two point clouds.

## Features

- **ICP Pose Estimation**: Implements the ICP algorithm to estimate the pose by aligning edges of 3D point clouds.
- **Edge Alignment**: Specializes in aligning edge points, which are critical for accurate pose estimation in environments with distinct geometric features.
- **Experimental Framework**: Provides a testbed for experimenting with different ICP configurations and optimizations.

## Usage

EdgeICP is designed for researchers and developers who are working on pose estimation problems, particularly where edge alignment is crucial. The repository can be used to conduct experiments, test hypotheses, and develop new methods for improving the accuracy and efficiency of ICP-based pose estimation.
